            Tulipa gesneriana, the Didier's tulip or garden tulip, is a
            species of plants in the lily family, cultivated as an ornamental in
            many countries because of its large, showy flowers. Its region of
            origin is not entirely certain, but the species is widely believed
            to have originated in Turkey, as is the case with many species of
            tulips that came into Europe from the Ottoman Empire. It has
            become naturalised in parts of central and southern Europe and
            scattered locations in North America. Most of the cultivated
            forms of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana.

            Goldenmane Tickseed is a North American plant species in the sunflower family. It is
            native to the southeastern and south-central United States from
            Texas to the Carolinas. Isolated populations (apparently escapes
            from cultivation) have been reported from Connecticut, Illinois, and
            California.

            The lemon, Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck, is a species of small evergreen
            tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia.
            The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and
            non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice,
            which has both culinary and cleaning uses.The pulp and rind
            (zest) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon
            is about 5% to 6% citric acid, which gives a sour taste. The
            distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in
            drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.
