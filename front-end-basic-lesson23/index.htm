          Tulipa gesneriana, the Didier's tulipor garden tulip, is a species of
          plants in the lily family, cultivated as an ornamental in many countries
          because of its large, showy flowers. Its region of origin is not entirely
          certain, but the species is widely believed to have originated in Turkey,
          as is the case with many species of tulips that came into Europe from the
          Ottoman Empire.It has become naturalised in parts of central and
          southern Europeand scattered locations in North America.Most of
          the cultivated forms of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana.

            The species is perennial and reproduces asexually. This plant produces

            The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and
            non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice,
            which has both culinary and cleaning uses.[2] The pulp and rind (zest)
            are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5%
            to 6% citric acid, which gives a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste
            of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as
            lemonade and lemon meringue pie.

            Nymphaeaceae /ˌnɪmfiːˈeɪsiː/ is a family of flowering plants, commonly
            called water lilies. They live as rhizomatous aquatic herbs in temperate
            and tropical climates around the world. The family contains five genera
            with about 70 known species.[2] Water lilies are rooted in soil in
            bodies of water, with leaves and flowers floating on or emergent from
            the surface. The leaves are round, with a radial notch in Nymphaea and
            Nuphar, but fully circular in Victoria and Euryale.
