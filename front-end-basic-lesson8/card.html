				Yangtze River Dolphin is pale blue to gray on the dorsal (back) side,
				and white on the ventral (belly) side. It has a long and slightly-upturned
				beak with 31â€“36 conical teeth on either jaw. Its dorsal fin is low and
				triangular in shape and resembles a light-colored flag when the dolphin
				swims just below the surface of the murky Yangtze River, hence the name
				"white-flag" dolphin. It has smaller eyes compared to oceanic dolphins.
